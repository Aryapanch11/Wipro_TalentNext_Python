# Through command line arguments three strings separated by space are given
# to you. Each string is a series of numbers separated by hyphen(-). You like all
# the numbers in string 1 and dislike all the numbers in string 2.
# Third string contains the numbers given to you. Your initial happiness is 0.
# When you encounter a number which is present in string 1, add 1 to your
# happiness, if it is present in string 2, add -1 to your happiness. Otherwise, your
# happiness does not change. Output your final happiness at the end.

# Sample input 1: 3-1 5-7 1-5-3-8
# Sample output 1: 1
# Explanation:
# Numbers in string 1: 3,
# Numbers in string 2: 5, 7
# Numbers given to you: 1, 5, 3, 8
# You gain 1 unit of happiness for numbers 1 and 3 which are in string 1. Your
# total happiness is 2 now.
# You lose 1 unit of happiness for number 5 which is in string 2. Your total
# happiness in 1 now.
# 8 is not present in either of the strings, so your happiness does not change.
# # Final happiness is 1.
